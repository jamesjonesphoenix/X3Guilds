Additional information can soon be found on Royal Commonwealth News feeds.

 <t id="102">Greetings, pilot. We have another task for you. Please return as soon as you can to the Darkspace Installation.</t>
 <t id="103">Please report back to me at the Darkspace Installation for a further mission briefing.</t>
 <t id="121">Stephen Torres works for a shady organisation called Darkspace. We need him on our side and to use his base for our own operations in the area. Our ultimate aim is to get our hands on some Terran, specifically ATF, tech. This guy is our way in as Darkspace also don't like the ATF much. He's been off the grid for a while, but his name suddenly popped up in some local pirate comms traffic that we intercepted. Since there aren't that many pirate bases in these parts, we expect he's likely to be lurking somewhere in the unknown sectors, north of Oort Cloud. We need you to get over there and locate him. Play it cagey at first, but remember that we want to be his friend.</t>
 <t id="301">Yes, I just got word myself. All is not lost though. We have a lead on the Darkspace guys and we're tracking them down. I need you to make contact with a black market dealer, called Darren We, who can provide us with some much-needed Terran high-tech goods for our experiments.</t>
 <t id="331">It looks like the Darkspace agents have fled to a sector called Maelstrom and have established a pirate base somewhere in the sector. I need you to get over there and rendezvous with Admiral Jarren Hayla, who is leading a Navy task force in that sector. I imagine they could use your help.</t>
 <t id="1301">Find and meet Stephen Torres of Darkspace in {sector.name@L2M015.US1}. We need to gain his trust in order for them to grant us access to their base.</t>
 <t id="1604">Well done! We now have Darkspace on side and Agent Evans is already en route to the Darkspace installation to set up our operation there. You're free to go about your business once more, but we may call on you again when there are further tasks.</t>

 <t id="124">Based on the information Mahi Ma finally revealed, we have found out that the Boron intend on assaulting your HUB in an attempt to capture it for their own use.  We cannot let them get their hands on the HUB so we will do everything in our power to make sure you keep hold of it.</t>
 <t id="125">Hub to {sector.name@L2M022.Segaris} and {sector.name@L2M022.XenonS}</t>
 <t id="126">{player.name}, To make it easier to assault the HUB, we would like you to rearrange the gates to put the HUB between \033B{sector.name@L2M022.Segaris}\033X and \033B{sector.name@L2M022.XenonS}\033X so our ships can get there easily.</t>
 <t id="127">{player.name}, this is Admiral Giorno. During an interrogation session, Mahi Ma revealed very interesting information about the Xenon HUB. We know that you are currently in control of it and there may be a plan in place by the Boron to take it from you.  We must stop this from happening, Report to {object.name@L2M022.SegarisDock} in {7,1021117}, so we can discuss the details of the plan.</t>
 <t id="522">Over recent months, the Boron have undertaken great efforts to encode their research data. While we have the best specialists for decrypting files in the whole universe, even they would need some time to decrypt the HQ data files, time that could be better spent on other things. If you can get information about the Boron encryption algorithm, it would certainly help our researchers.\n\nWhen I monitored Boron fleet movements, I noticed a small Boron group commuting between {7,1020419} and {7,1020716} each week. They don't carry any special wares or personnel, so I believe that it is this group that provides the Argon military with the latest information about the latest Boron research results. They probably also have information in their database that could help our scientists to decode their data.\n\nAs we learned from our previous mission, Boron escorts are not exactly what you would call invincible. So it should be easy for you to convince the Boron to provide you with the data, by one means or another.\n\nGood luck Sir, Sub-Lieutenant Jorwan out.</t>
